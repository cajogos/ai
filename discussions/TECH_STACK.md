That's a great idea! Storing the content in a version-controlled system using Markdown files will indeed make the information more portable and easily accessible. In this case, you can use a static site generator to create your knowledge base. Here's a revised tech stack based on your preferences:

Static Site Generator:

Gatsby.js or Next.js (React-based) or Nuxt.js (Vue-based) for generating a static site from your Markdown files.
Content Management:

Markdown files for storing and organizing the content.
Version Control:

Git for version control and collaboration.
GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket as a remote repository hosting service.
Styling and Responsiveness:

Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for styling and creating a responsive design.
Deployment & Hosting:

Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for deploying and hosting the static site.
With this tech stack, you can keep all your content in Markdown files, which will be easily version-controlled using Git. The static site generator will then convert these Markdown files into HTML pages for your knowledge base. This approach offers the benefits of easy content management, version control, and portability.
